<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Bread of choice, I prefer Baguettes</li>
    <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic per slice of bread</li>
    <li>Your favorite Italian seasoning</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Prep your pan & bread. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or tinfoil, slice your bread in half lengthwise, and place the bread cut side up on the baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Make the garlic butter. In a small bowl mix the herbs and salt together with the softened butter. Spread it evenly over the top of the bread halves.</li>
    <li>Bake & serve. Bake the bread for 10-15 minutes at 425 degrees F until it’s slightly golden brown on the edges. If you’re adding cheese, add it in the last 2 minutes of baking. Then cool, slice into 1-inch pieces, and devour!</li>
